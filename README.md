This page contains all of the evidence requested and the following narrative and `What would I improve` answer.

## #1 Create Git Repo:
I chose to fork the existing repo

## #2 Deploy to public cloud
Cloud native applications are usually not deployed directly to a virtual server. So for this exercise I chose to skip that deployment.

## #3 Deploy the app in a Docker container
I created a local docker container and accessed it via curl, then deployed it via terraform to ECS. (Sometimes I will manually create resources when experimenting with a new service, but for most work I choose to go directly to terraform.)

After deploying to ECS and going to the root url I get an error. This appears to be an issue with the x509 package not having the Amazon root CA. Manually accessing the URL that failed gives me the secret word. I later changed the docker image from `node:slim` to `node:latest` and the root page started working.

## #4 Inject the Secret Word
At first I just passed in my own secret word. But after completing steps 5 & 7, I went back and passed in the real secret word.

## #5 and #7 Deploy Load Balancer, with TLS
I started by adding the load balancer in front of the ECS with TLS right from the start. Once that worked, I moved the ECS service into the private subnets.
